## Prayer

## The Confession

**God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them; he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain; he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands; to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.**

## The Intro

- How God is not like us
  - Needs nothing from us
  - He is holy - he would not do as we do
  - He is wise - he would not think as we think
  - He is immutable - he is without passions--we are full of passions
    - Lord of the Rings quote here
  - He is Triune
    - Augustine - Three persons, three wills, three minds, three hearts. Triune God--three persons, one will, one mind, one heart.
- Who God is to us
- What God has said to us?
- What God has given to us?
- How God is like us

## So what?

- How God is toward us and for us
  - God is creator of Creation
    - made something out of nothing
    - made us out of dust
    - made us to reflect his image
      - not monkeys, not apes, not gorillas, not kittens or puppies but mankind
  - God is holy and sovereign
    - Gave the law to Adam
    - Gave the law to Moses
    - Gave the lawkeeper to us
  - God is perfect and just
    - we broke his laws
    - God gave and broke his Son so that we would be saved to him
      - He is compassionate towards us Psalm 103
  - God is perfectly good and perfectly wise
    - whatever he does, it is out of maxed out goodness and maxed out wisdom--he does not have to compromise one to uphold the other--like all of his attributes
      - maxed out attributes => His glory
  - He is God
  - Loving - Eph 1
  - Merciful - Gen 3
  - Kind - Romans 2
